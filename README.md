# Prototype Data Scaling

## Task description:

> Technology: back-end framework of your choice

> Code that works at 100 database records sometimes breaks at 10,000 records.
> You investigate how to start testing here in a smooth way, identify possible bottlenecks and try out solutions.
> 
> Provide a site that provides an overview of all the (fictional) flora in the world.
> For each flower or plant, the (again fictitious) discoverer should be linked.
> It should be possible to look up when something is in bloom or when it should be planted.
> 
> Your prototype takes into account at least the following:
> 
> A smooth way to populate your database with dummy data
> N+1 problem
> Caching possibilities
> Test with 100 records, 10,000 and 1,000,000
> Use your readme to document the main bottlenecks
